# JavaScript Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts

This repository contains solutions to various Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts implemented in JavaScript. Each concept is demonstrated with code examples and explanations.

## Concepts Covered

1. Class and Objects
2. Inheritance
3. Encapsulation
4. Abstraction
5. Polymorphism
6. Getter & Setter

## Instructions

Each concept is implemented in a separate JavaScript file named accordingly. You can explore each file to understand the implementation and how the concept is applied in JavaScript.

## Usage

To run the code, you can use any JavaScript environment or simply run the files in a web browser console.


## Concepts Description

- **Class and Objects**: Demonstrates how to create classes and objects in JavaScript using the `class` keyword.
- **Inheritance**: Shows how to implement inheritance using the `extends` keyword in JavaScript classes.
- **Encapsulation**: Explains how to achieve encapsulation in JavaScript using private and public members.
- **Abstraction**: Demonstrates abstraction by hiding the complex implementation details and exposing only necessary functionalities.
- **Polymorphism**: Illustrates polymorphism in JavaScript through method overriding and method overloading.
